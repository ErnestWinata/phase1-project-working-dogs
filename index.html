        <p>Working dog breeds are canines on a mission. They love nothing more than a job to do and will work tirelessly to get it done. Working dog breeds come from all over the world and are, as their name suggests, hard-working breeds specifically developed to excel in specialist, non-herding jobs. This is primarily guarding and protection for people, livestock or property.</p>
